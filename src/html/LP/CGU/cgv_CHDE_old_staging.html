    <p style="margin-left: in;"><strong>1.1<span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Order Procedure</span></strong></p>
    
    <p>A detailed description of the Products is available when viewing individual Products on the Site.<br />
    <br />
    The system, as implemented, assumes an active effort from you. It complies with the legal requirements for online sales and consumer protection.<br />
    <br />
    To order the Products you want, there are two options:<br />
    <br />
    a. Go to the product page for the Product you would like to purchase by clicking its photo, selecting the packaging you want, and then clicking<span style="color:null;"> &ldquo;Add to cart&rdquo;. Your selections will automatically be added to your cart.<br />
    <br />
    b. Place a quick order by clicking &ldquo;Add to cart&rdquo; directly on the Product overview (without clicking the photo and going to the product page). The Product will then be added to your cart.</span></p>
    
    <p><span style="color:null;">Products will always be added to your cart with the quantity &ldquo;1&rdquo; by default. You can then update the quantity when viewing your cart by clicking &ldquo;Cart&rdquo;, </span>as described in the procedure below.<br />
    You have the option to select multiple quantities of the same Product by changing the quantity in your cart view. You can also remove a previously selected Product by clicking the &ldquo;X&rdquo; button at the top-right corner of each Product.<br />
    <br />
    Once you have added all the Products you want to the cart, you can add a coupon code by entering that code into the<span style="color:null;"> &ldquo;Promo&nbsp;code&rdquo; field and then clicking &ldquo;OK&rdquo; to subm</span>it it. Coupon codes cannot be combined with other discounts. Only coupon codes and other discounts specific to the Site (ex. ongoing promotions) will be accepted on the Site.<br />
    <span style="color:null;"><br />
    To confirm your order, click the &ldquo;Checkout&rdquo; button or &ldquo;PayPal&rdquo; in the</span> right column of your cart.</p>
    
    <p>&middot; <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">If you have not yet created a customer account:</span></em></strong></p>
    
    <p>You can either (i) be redirected to a page where you can place an order as a guest, without creating an account, or (ii) create an ac<span style="color:null;">count using the &ldquo;<strong>Log in</strong>&rdquo; button and then clicking the &ldquo;Create account&rdquo; button. Follow the instructions and enter your email address along with the other required information, and then click &ldquo;Create account&rdquo;.<br />
    <br />
    You also have the option of creating an account through Facebook Connect by entering your Facebook credentials and clicking &ldquo;Login with Facebook&rdquo; and filling out the form with your complete shipping and billing information. You can also choose to create an account through Google by clicking &ldquo;Login with Google&rdquo;.</span><br />
    <br />
    Your customer account will then be created, and you will receive a new account confirmation email at the email address you provided.<br />
    <br />
    By creating your customer account, you acknowledge having read and unconditionally accepted the General Terms of Sale and Use and the Personal Data Protection <strong><span style="color: blue;"><a href="$url('Page-Show','cid','privacy-policy')$">Privacy Policy</a></span></strong>.</p>
    
    <p>&middot; <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">If you have already created a customer account:</span></em></strong></p>
    
    <p>If you haven't yet logged in to your customer account, you can get direct access to your account by clicking on &quot;Log in,&quot; which will allow you to enter your credentials (email address and password) and click on the &quot;Log in&quot; button.<br />
    <br />
    Next, choose an address from your list of saved addresses, or enter a new one under the &quot;Address Book&quot; tab, and select a delivery method from the list provided. If you have already logged in to your customer account, you will be sent directly to this page.<br />
    <br />
    To confirm your selections, click on &quot;Next: Payment.&quot;<br />
    <br />
    Choose your payment method, confirm your order details, check the box that reads &quot;I accept the general terms of sale and the privacy policy,&quot; then click on &quot;Confirm and pay&quot; to finalize your order.<br />
    <br />
    If you forget any of these steps, your order will be invalid.<br />
    <br />
    You will not be able to modify or cancel your order once we have approved the order details and you have received your order confirmation email.</p>
    
    <p style="margin-left: in;"><strong>1.2<span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Order Acceptance</span></strong></p>
    
    <p>Before entering into the sales contract, you will see an order confirmation on your screen, detailing your entire order and the prices, including tax (excluding shipping costs and any additional taxes or customs duties), where you will be a<span style="color:null;">ble to modify or cancel your order. To confirm the purchase order, you must acknowledge that placing your order entails the obligation to pay for it in full, and you must expressly acknowledge and accept the General Terms of Sale and Use by checking the associated boxes and then clicking the &ldquo;Confirm and continue to payment&rdquo; button. Checking the abovementioned boxes is a basic requirement before confirming your order.</span></p>
    
    <p><span style="color:null;">The act of completing the order confirmation on the Site, paying for your order, and confirming it by clicking the &ldquo;Confirm and continue to payment&rdquo; implies yo</span>ur full and unconditional acceptance of these General Terms of Sale and Use.The General Terms of Sale and Use shall be the only terms applicable to the contract thus entered. For any purchase on our Site, you will receive a confirmation email containing your order number, details of the Products ordered, and information you can use to track the processing and shipment of the Products.</p>

    <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Warranty Against Latent Defects</span></strong></p>
    
    <p>Pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1641 et seq. of the French Civil Code, Orientis Gourmet is bound to a warranty on account of the &ldquo;latent defects of the thing sold which render it unfit for the use for which it was intended, or which so impair that use that the buyer would not have acquired it, or would only have given a lesser price for it, had he known of them.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>In the event of a legal warranty action:</p>
    
    <p>In the event of a noncompliant shipment, you have up to twenty-four (24) months after the date when the Products were delivered to act. Moreover, you are not required to provide proof of the noncompliance within the six (6) months following the delivery of the Products.</p>
    
    <p>In the event of a noncompliance, you may choose between the repair or replacement of the product. However, the seller may not proceed with the purchaser&rsquo;s choice if that choice involves a cost that is clearly disproportionate with respect to the other option, given the value of the product or the significance of the defect. The seller is then bound to proceed, unless doing so is possible, according to the method not selected by the purchaser.</p>
    
    <p>If the warranty against latent defects is implemented:</p>
    
    <p>Pursuant to Article 1644 of the French Civil Code, you have the choice either of returning the thing and having the price repaid to you or of keeping the thing and having a part of the price repaid to you, as appraised by experts.</p>
    
    <p>The action resulting from the latent defects must be brought by the purchaser within two (2) years from when the defect was discovered, in accordance with Article 1648 of the French Civil Code.</p>
    
    <p><strong>8.<span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Retention of Ownership</span></strong></p>
    
    <p><span>The Products shipped to you are sold with no retention of ownership. Transfer of ownership is subject to the full payment of the price of the Products, by the date agreed between the parties. Products therefore remain the property of Orientis Gourmet until orders have been paid in full.</span></p>

    <p><strong>13.<span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Disputes &ndash; Applicable Law</span></strong></p>
    
    <p>Only the French-language versions of the General Terms of Sale and General Terms of Use are legally enforceable. If they are translated into one or more other languages, only the French text shall apply in the event of a legal dispute.</p>

    <p>National or cross-border disputes that may arise about the validity, interpretation, execution, non-execution, disruption, or termination of any contract entered into under the terms set forth by the General Terms of Sale and Use may be subject to mediation at your request.</p>
    
    <p><span>For such purpose, in the event of a dispute, pursuant to Article L.612-1 of the French Consumer Code, you may use the Medicys mediation service, which Orientis Gourmet supports, free of charge, electronically at: </span><strong><span style="color: blue;"><a class="external" href="https://app.medicys.fr/?proId=5dd6e2c8-6d5d-4e1b-81e1-515f6b6da11a" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://app.medicys.fr/?proId=5dd6e2c8-6d5d-4e1b-81e1-515f6b6da11a</a></span></strong><span> or by mail at: MEDICYS &ndash; 73 Boulevard de Clichy &ndash; 75009 PARIS &ndash; FRANCE.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>However, the dispute cannot be reviewed by the mediator if:</span></p>
    
    <p><span>&middot; </span><span>you do not demonstrate having first attempted to resolve the claim directly through Orientis Gourmet with a written complaint;</span></p>
    
    <p><span>&middot; </span><span>the request is manifestly unfounded or abusive;</span></p>
    
    <p><span>&middot; </span><span>the dispute has been previously reviewed or is currently under review by another mediator or by a court;</span></p>
    
    <p><span>&middot; </span><span>you submitted your request to the mediator more than one (1) year after the written complaint was sent to Orientis Gourmet;</span></p>
    
    <p><span>&middot; </span><span>the dispute is not within the mediator&rsquo;s jurisdiction.</span></p>
