    The system, as implemented, assumes an active effort from you. It complies with the legal requirements for online sales and consumer protection.<br />
    <br />
    To order the Products you want, there are two options:<br />
    <br />
    a. Go to the product page for the Product you would like to purchase by clicking its photo, selecting the packaging you want, and then clicking <span style="color:null;">&ldquo;</span></span><span style="color:null;"><span class="m-terms">Add to cart</span>&rdquo;. Your selections will automatically be added to your cart.<br />
    <br />
    b. Place a quick order by clicking &ldquo;Add to cart&rdquo; directly on the Product overview (without clicking the photo and going to the product page). The Product will then be added to your cart.</span></span></p>
    
    <p><span class="m-terms"><span style="color:null;">Products will always be added to your cart with the quantity &ldquo;1&rdquo; by default. You can then update the quantity when viewing your cart by clicking &ldquo;Cart&rdquo;, </span>as described in the procedure below.<br />
    You have the option to select multiple quantities of the same Product by changing the quantity in your cart view. You can also remove a previously selected Product by clicking the &ldquo;X&rdquo; button at the top-right corner of each Product.<br />
    <br />
    Once you have added all the Products you want to the cart, you can add a coupon code by entering that code into the &ldquo;<span style="color:null;">Promo code&rdquo; field and then clicking &ldquo;OK&rdquo; to submit it. Coupon codes cannot be combined with other discounts. Only coupon codes and other discounts specific to the Site (ex. ongoing promotions) will be accepted on the Site.<br />
