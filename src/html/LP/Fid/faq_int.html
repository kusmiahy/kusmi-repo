            How can I redeem my points?
        </p>

        <p class="c-toggler__content">
            Once you have reached 70 points, they will be converted into a loyalty voucher worth €5, valid for three months from the date of issue. If you have collected 140 points at once, you will immediately receive a shopping voucher worth €10.

            How can I collect points and benefit from shopping vouchers?
        </p>

        <p class="c-toggler__content">
            Once you have become a member of the free Kusmiklub, you can collect one point for every euro you spend on the website or in one of our stores.
            <br>
            You can use the points to receive loyalty vouchers. You will receive a loyalty voucher worth €5 every 70 points.
            <br>
            Example: You collected 40 points on your first purchase, then you make a second purchase where you collect another 45 points. Your points balance is now 85 points. You receive a voucher for €5 (for 70 points) and your remaining points balance is 15 points.
            <br>
            The points are valid for 12 months from the last purchase made with customer identification, unless they are converted into a voucher (all 70 points).
            <br>
            Note: When using a loyalty voucher, you do not earn points on the amount deducted with the voucher (example: I make a purchase of €45 and use a voucher for €5, i.e. a total amount paid of €40: I will be credited with 40 points).

            How long are the points valid for?
        </p>

        <p class="c-toggler__content">
            The points are valid for 12 months from the last purchase made with identification via the customer's loyalty account, unless they are converted into a voucher (all 70 points). If they are converted into a voucher, the validity period of the voucher is 3 months from the date of issue. The remaining points are valid for 12 months.
            <br>
            If you have not made a purchase after 12 months, the points will expire and your points balance will automatically be reset to 0.
