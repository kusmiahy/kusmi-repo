It is a substance that has the capacity to increase the elimination of sodium (a mineral salt) and water by the kidneys. More concretely, diuretics help the body to eliminate more water and salt than usual. This elimination takes place via urinary secretions. As a result of this avoidance of salt, blood pressure is lowered, which is beneficial to our cardiovascular system. If several foods are known to be effective diuretics (artichoke, asparagus, aubergine, spinach...), black tea is added to the list, thanks to the presence of theine and theobromine.... and it is much easier to prepare!
