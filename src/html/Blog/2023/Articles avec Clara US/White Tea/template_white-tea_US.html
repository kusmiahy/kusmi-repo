However, what sets white tea apart is its minimal processing. The leaves and buds of the tea plant are plucked in their early stages of growth, usually before they fully unfurl. This limited processing allows white tea to retain a higher amount of its natural compounds, resulting in a subtler and more delicate flavor compared to other tea varieties.",

Start by using fresh, filtered water that's not boiling hot—around 175°F (80°C) is ideal. Allow the tea leaves to steep for about 2-3 minutes to bring out their subtle flavors. You can enjoy white tea as it is or add a touch of honey or a slice of lemon for added taste. It's a tea best savored without milk to fully appreciate its nuanced qualities.
