It includes various types such as black tea, green tea, white tea, and oolong tea. These teas all contain caffeine and share a common origin. On the other hand, herbal tea, also known as tisane or infusion, is made from an assortment of herbs, spices, flowers, fruits, and botanicals. Unlike tea, herbal infusions do not contain leaves from the Camellia sinensis plant and are therefore naturally caffeine-free. They offer a wide range of flavors, aromas, and potential health benefits based on the specific ingredients used.",
